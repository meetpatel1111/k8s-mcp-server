# Cloud Provider Limitations

This document describes known limitations and workarounds when using the k8s-mcp-server with different cloud providers.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

### Managed Node Restrictions

The following tools will fail on AKS system nodepools due to Azure's managed node restrictions:

| Tool | Error | Workaround |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `k8s_add_node_label` | HTTP 400 | AKS system nodepools do not allow user label modifications. Use custom nodepools for label modifications. |
| `k8s_add_node_taint` | HTTP 400 | AKS system nodepools do not allow taint modifications. Use custom nodepools for taint modifications. |

**Note**: These restrictions apply to AKS-managed system nodepools. Custom nodepools may allow these operations.

### NetworkPolicy with Calico

When using Calico as the network plugin on AKS, NetworkPolicy creation may fail with HTTP 400 errors due to Calico-specific format requirements.

**Known Issue**: `k8s_create_networkpolicy` may fail on AKS with Calico

**Workarounds**:
1. Try a minimal NetworkPolicy with empty podSelector:
   ```json
   {
     "podSelector": {},
     "policyTypes": ["Ingress"]
   }
   ```
2. Check Calico network policy documentation for AKS-specific requirements
3. Use `kubectl describe networkpolicy <name>` to see detailed error messages
4. Consider using Calico-specific network policy CRDs if standard Kubernetes NetworkPolicies are insufficient

### Rollout Operations

Some rollout operations may be restricted by AKS RBAC:

| Tool | Error | Workaround |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `k8s_rollout_pause` | HTTP 400 | AKS RBAC may restrict pause operations. Use direct deployment updates instead. |

### Log Streaming Limitations

The Kubernetes log API uses streaming responses which are not fully supported in the MCP context:

| Tool | Limitation | Workaround |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `k8s_get_pod_logs` | Follow mode (real-time streaming) not supported | Use `kubectl logs -f` for real-time streaming. MCP returns initial logs only. |
| `k8s_get_pod_logs` | HTTP request failed for containers with no logs | Returns "(no logs available)" message. Use kubectl for direct access. |
| `k8s_get_pod_logs` | Streaming endpoints timeout | MCP HTTP client may timeout on streaming responses. Use kubectl instead. |

**Note**: This is a general MCP limitation, not specific to any cloud provider. The log API requires persistent HTTP connections or WebSockets for streaming, which the MCP server's HTTP client doesn't support in this environment.

### Strategic Merge Patch

AKS API server may reject strategic merge patch requests in certain scenarios. The MCP server now includes automatic fallback to merge patch when strategic merge fails.

**Automatic Fallback**: When `k8s_patch` with `patchType: "strategic"` fails with a validation error, the server automatically retries with `patchType: "merge"`.

**Manual Workaround**: Explicitly use `patchType: "merge"` if strategic merge consistently fails.

## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

No known limitations at this time. The MCP server is expected to work with GKE clusters without issues.

## Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

No known limitations at this time. The MCP server is expected to work with EKS clusters without issues.

## Self-Managed Clusters

The MCP server works with any Kubernetes cluster that supports standard kubeconfig-based authentication. No specific limitations for self-managed clusters.

## General Recommendations

1. **Test in non-production environments first**: Always test MCP server operations in a development/staging environment before using in production.

2. **Check RBAC permissions**: Ensure your kubeconfig has sufficient permissions for the operations you intend to perform.

3. **Use resource-specific delete tools**: For LimitRange and ResourceQuota, use `k8s_delete_limitrange` and `k8s_delete_resourcequota` instead of the generic `k8s_delete` tool.

4. **Monitor API server latency**: Some cloud providers (especially in certain regions) may have higher API latency. The `k8s_api_latency_check` tool can help diagnose performance issues.

5. **Enable metrics-server**: For resource usage metrics (top node, top pod), install metrics-server on your cluster. See [METRICS_SERVER.md](METRICS_SERVER.md) for installation instructions.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter limitations or issues with specific cloud providers that are not documented here, please:

1. Review the error message and suggestions provided by the MCP server
2. Check the `k8s_cluster_health` and `k8s_health_score` tools for cluster diagnostics
3. Open an issue on GitHub with:
   - Cloud provider and region
   - Kubernetes version
   - MCP server version
   - Tool name and parameters used
   - Full error message
   - Steps to reproduce
